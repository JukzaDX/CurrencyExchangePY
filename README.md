Disclaimer: As of 7th June, the conversion rates are accurate. In the future they may not be.
Reminder to myself or anyone who uses this program: if the exchange rate is inaccurate(which it would be), change the float number on the exchange function with however much USD 1 Euro is worth.

This program was made using the Tkinter library, so to run this program obviously have python installed and done -pip install Tkinter
It mainly converts from the EURO to the UNITED STATES DOLLAR. Not much. cool?
